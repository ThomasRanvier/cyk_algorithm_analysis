This is the report of the efficient algorithms assignment on the CYK parser.

The point of the assignment was firstly to discover and implement the CYK algorithm using several development approaches.
Then the goal was to experiment with the implementations and compare their efficiencies for diverse context-free grammars in the Chomsky normal-form.

After that the task was to design a parser that can work with linear grammars, to implement it and then to experiment with it in order to compare its efficency to the other parsers.

Then the final goal was to design and implement a parser that does not simply return true if the string is part of the language and false otherwise, but corrects the input string and returns a proposed correction with the needed number of character modifications and deletions.
